Dear diary,

 

Happy birthday to me! I know turning 54 may not be very exciting to most people, but today is special to me for other reasons.

 

You see, I’m throwing a huge party today to celebrate my birthday. I’ve invited political leaders and celebrities from all around the world, but the person I’m most excited to see is from right here in the US. That’s right—it’s Bill Clinton.

 

The reason I’m so excited to see him is because he’s the President of the United States of America, and that’s it. That’s the only reason. I’m not gay or anything. This stays between you and me, diary, but when I’m older I want to be just like him—I want to be the president.

 

People sometimes say that my dreams are stupid. They say that I could never be the president even if I tried. But here’s what I always say: never listen to the haters. You know what? To prove that I really want to be president someday, I’m even going to make it my special birthday wish this year, because everyone knows that birthday wishes always come true. What could possibly go wrong?

 

Anyway, that’s all I have time for right now, diary. I told Melania that I would help with the birthday party planning just so she would stop nagging me. And let’s be honest, she has horrible taste in party decorations. She always picks out girly colors that do absolutely nothing for my complexion. God, I hate women. The only colors I’m interested in are the good ol’ red white and blue. Oh, Bill is gonna love this.

 

Sincerely,

Donny XOXO

I tuck my diary back under my mattress with a smile on my face—a smile that lingers long after I’ve made my way downstairs to help plan the party. Even my wife, Melania, couldn’t ruin this special day. But that won’t stop her from trying.

 

“Donald!” She calls, racing into the room. “Our guests are going to arrive in 15 minutes! Where have you been?”

 

“I’ve just been- I’ve been doing some work. Very important work. Some might say the most important work, in fact. You know, Birthday Boy is a very big responsibility. But I’m going to have the best birthday. No one else knows how to do a birthday party like mine. Everyone is talking about it, saying that no one has done a birthday quite like me before-”

 

“That’s great.” Melania interrupts, like a bitch. “Do you still want the red, white, and blue birthday cake?”

 

Before I can answer, the front door swings open and in walks Bill Clinton. A blush spreads across my orange cheeks as the powerful scent of his masculine pheromones washes over me. His eyes meet mine, and for a second the entire world seems to come to a halt. He and I understand each other in a way that only the best, most intelligent, most handsome, straightest men possibly could. When he’s around me, I’m finally able to think clearly—it’s like magic.

 

But before I know it, the spell is broken.

 

“Donald! Melania! It’s so good to see you! Hillary is just grabbing her things, she’ll be joining us in just a moment.” Bill joyfully shakes my wife’s hand and then walks over to shake mine. But the physical contact doesn’t excite me as much as it usually would. I can’t stop thinking about her.

 

Hillary.

 

I hate that woman so damn much. She somehow brings out the worst version of Bill, which seems like it should be impossible because he’s just so perfect. No one else understands the intensity of my hatred, but that’s just because they’ve never seen the version of Bill that I have. I make him better in a way that Hillary never could. And I’m not jealous, that’s just a fact.

 

Only a few moments go by until she walks through the door, like she doesn’t even care that she’s not wanted here. I can’t bear to look at her right now, so I stomp off to the kitchen to clear my head.

 

As I exit, I hear the unmistakable sound of powerful, manly footsteps following after me. My anger instantly vanishes, and my heart soars with the possibility. Could it be? I spin on my heels, and all my hopes and dreams are confirmed. Bill followed me in here. He cares about me.

 

I need to maintain an air of mystery about myself, so I quickly hide my excitement and act as if I don’t care.

 

“What do you want?” I grumble, unable to meet his piercing blue gaze.

 

“Oh, Donny,” he chuckles, and the low sound sends vibrations up my spine. “You may think you have everyone fooled with your tough guy act, but I know the real you.”

 

With a soft gasp, I finally bring my eyes up to his. And there’s a heat in them that I’ve never seen before. One that I’m sure matches the heat I feel inside my own soul. If I didn’t know better, I would say it feels a lot like desire.

 

“Y- you do?” I ask, unable to keep the nervous stutter out of my voice.

 

“Oh, I know you a lot better than you think,” he growls, bringing his fingers up to very gently caress my face. “In fact, I think I might even know you better than you know yourself.”

 

He grabs my tie, and for a second I think he’s going to pull me closer, but he doesn’t. Why am I… disappointed?

 

“Well Donny,” Bill says, bringing me back to the problem at hand before I can read too much into our brief intimate moment. “What do you say we go back out there? We shouldn’t keep the ladies waiting too long, or they’ll wonder what we’re up to.” He winks.

 

I know I should be mature, but it’s taking all of my willpower not to stomp my foot on the ground and throw a tantrum like a three year old. Having to hold a conversation with Hillary Clinton, of all people, is pretty much the furthest from my idea of a good birthday.

 

I think Bill can tell just how much I do not want to do this, because his eyes darken as he says, “or… we could go back to the White House. I know how badly you’ve been wanting to see it, and who am I to deny you a special tour on your birthday?” Maybe it’s just the light, but I swear I see his eyes glimmer suggestively as he murmurs these words.

 

Not trusting my own voice, I just nod my head, which seems to be enough of a response for Bill. A wide grin spreads across his face, and before I know it, he’s taking me by the hand and leading me to his car to take us to the White House.

 

I can hardly believe it. I’m on my way to the White House. With President Bill Clinton.


So far, this is the best. Birthday. Ever.
